# -Nusrat_Fateh_Ali_Khan-s_lyrics-Text_Generation_with_an_RNN_LSTM
This project uses an RNN-LSTM model to generate lyrics in the style of Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan. By training on his lyrics, the model learns linguistic patterns, themes, and poetic structure. It generates new lyrics resembling his style, aiding cultural preservation and showcasing AI's role in musicology and creative arts.


**Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan's Lyrics Text Generation with RNN-LSTM**

**Overview:**  
This project aims to create a deep learning model capable of generating lyrics in the style of the legendary Qawwali singer, Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan, using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) units. The model learns from the intricate patterns, themes, and linguistic styles found in Nusrat's lyrics, producing coherent and stylistically faithful lyric sequences.

**Data Collection and Preparation:**  
- **Dataset:** A comprehensive collection of Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan's lyrics is compiled, covering various songs in Urdu and Punjabi, and organized into a text corpus.
- **Preprocessing:** The lyrics are tokenized, converted to lowercase, special characters are removed, and sequences are encoded for input into the RNN model.
- **Sequence Creation:** Lyrics are segmented into overlapping sequences to facilitate the model's learning of word patterns and structures.

**Model Architecture:**  
1. **Base Model (RNN-LSTM):** The core architecture consists of LSTM layers that capture long-term dependencies in the lyrics, allowing the model to learn the sequential nature of the text.
2. **Embedding Layer:** An embedding layer transforms the input sequences into dense vector representations, capturing semantic relationships between words.
3. **Output Layer:** A softmax layer generates probability distributions over the vocabulary for the next word prediction.

**Training and Optimization:**  
- **Training Procedure:** The model is trained using backpropagation through time (BPTT) with sequences fed in batches, allowing for efficient learning from large datasets.
- **Optimizer:** The Adam optimizer is utilized with a learning rate set at 0.001 for stable convergence during training.
- **Loss Function:** Categorical cross-entropy loss is employed to measure the performance of the model in generating the correct next word.

**Performance Evaluation:**  
- **Metrics:** Perplexity and loss metrics are tracked to evaluate model performance. Additionally, qualitative analysis of generated lyrics assesses coherence and stylistic alignment.
- **Validation Accuracy:** The model's ability to generate plausible lyric sequences is benchmarked through comparison with a validation set, ensuring it maintains fidelity to Nusrat's style.
- **Generated Samples:** Examples of generated lyrics are presented to illustrate the model’s effectiveness and the diversity of outputs.

**Results and Findings:**  
- **Creativity and Coherence:** The model demonstrates the ability to produce creative, coherent lyrics that reflect Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan’s thematic elements and lyrical structure.
- **Stylistic Fidelity:** Generated outputs are qualitatively assessed and compared to original lyrics, showing significant alignment with Nusrat's style.

**Conclusion:**  
This project showcases an innovative application of deep learning in natural language processing, emphasizing the potential for AI to capture and replicate the artistic essence of legendary musicians like Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan. The successful generation of lyrics not only preserves cultural heritage but also opens avenues for creative expression in music and poetry through AI.
